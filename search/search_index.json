What is Model Deployment? Model deployment refers to the process of integrating a trained machine learning or statistical model into a production environment. The goal is to make the model's capabilities available to end-users, applications, or services. In the context of data science, deploying a model often means offering it as a service where applications send data to the model and receive predictions in return. Why is Model Deployment Crucial? Jupyter notebook or a local environment doesn't add business value. To realize its potential value, it must be made available where it's needed. Model deployment is the bridge between building a model and getting it into the hands of users. It's the last step in the data science pipeline but often one of the most complex. Without effective deployment, even the most sophisticated models are of little use. Challenges in Model Deployment: Model deployment is a complex process that involves several challenges. Some of the most common ones are: Scalability : Models may need to handle thousands of requests per second in some applications. It's crucial to ensure that deployment solutions can scale as needed. Latency : Especially in real-time applications, the time taken for a model to provide a prediction (latency) can be critical. Version Control : Models evolve over time. Deployment strategies need to account for versioning to ensure consistent and reproducible results. Dependency Management : Models might rely on specific libraries and versions, making dependency management a significant concern during deployment. While understanding the importance and intricacies of model deployment is crucial, the practical aspect involves choosing a suitable method for deployment. One of the most popular and effective ways to deploy our models is by using REST APIs . REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs provide a standardized way to make our models accessible over the internet. This method not only makes it easier to integrate our models into different applications but also offers scalability and flexibility. With REST APIs, we can encapsulate our models as services that can be consumed by various applications, be it web, mobile, or other services. What is an API? An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software entities to communicate with each other. It specifies how software components should interact, enabling the integration of different systems and sharing of data and functionality. Key Concepts in API: Endpoint : A specific address or URL where an API can be accessed. Request & Response : The essential interaction in an API involves sending a request and receiving a response. Rate Limiting : Restrictions on how many API calls a user or system can make within a specified time frame. While various types of APIs exist, such as SOAP , GraphQL , and RPC , we'll be concentrating on REST APIs in this course due to their ubiquity and relevance in deploying machine learning models. Overview of RESTful Services: REST , or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful services or APIs are designed around the principles of REST and use standard HTTP methods . Principles of REST: Statelessness : Each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request. The server retains no session information. Client-Server Architecture : REST APIs follow a client-server model where the client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, and the server manages the data. Cacheability : Responses from the server can be cached on the client side to improve performance. Uniform Interface : A consistent and unified interface simplifies and decouples the architecture. Deploying a machine learning model using REST APIs is a common practice in the industry. It allows us to encapsulate our model as a service that can be consumed by other applications. This approach offers several advantages: Platform Independence : RESTful APIs can be consumed by any client that understands HTTP, regardless of the platform or language. Scalability : RESTful services are stateless, making it easier to scale by simply adding more servers. Performance : With the ability to cache responses, REST APIs can reduce the number of requests, improving the performance. Flexibility : Data can be returned in multiple formats, such as JSON or XML, allowing for flexibility in how it's consumed. APIs, especially RESTful APIs, are essential tools in the world of software integration. In the context of deploying data science models, they provide a mechanism to make the model accessible to other systems and applications in a standardized manner. As we delve deeper into this course, we'll see how to harness the power of REST APIs to deploy and serve our machine learning models efficiently. Components of REST APIs: Endpoints: An endpoint refers to a specific address (URL) in an API where particular functions can be accessed. For example, /predict might be an endpoint for a machine learning model where you send data for predictions. For example, https://api.example.com/predict could be an endpoint for a machine learning model where you send data for predictions. HTTP Methods: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to denote the type of action to be performed: - GET : Retrieve data. - POST : Send data for processing or create a new resource. - PUT : Update an existing resource. - DELETE : Remove a resource. Status Codes: HTTP status codes are standard response codes given by web servers on the Internet. They help identify the success or failure of an API request. - 200 OK : Successful request. - 201 Created : Request was successful, and a resource was created. - 400 Bad Request : The server could not understand the request. - 401 Unauthorized : The client must authenticate itself. - 404 Not Found : The requested resource could not be found. - 500 Internal Server Error : A generic error message when an unexpected condition was encountered. Requests & Responses: Interacting with REST APIs involves sending requests and receiving responses. The request and response formats are standardized and follow a specific structure: - Request : Comprises the endpoint, method, headers, and any data sent to the server. - Response : Includes the status code, headers, and any data sent back from the server. Understanding the foundational elements of REST APIs is crucial for effectively designing, consuming, and deploying services on the web. As we transition to building our own APIs for model deployment, this knowledge will ensure we create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly interfaces for our models. Interacting with REST APIs using Python Python has a powerful library called requests that simplifies making requests to REST APIs. In this section, we will explore how to use this library to interact with an example API. For our hands-on learning, we'll fetch weather data using the requests library in Python. The requests library is a de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a simple API. In the following example, we'll use the requests library to fetch weather data from an API. OpenWeatherMap offers weather data, which is free for limited access. Although you typically need an API key, for brevity, we're using a mock API endpoint for our exercise. Crafting a GET Request for Weather Data We can use the requests library to make a GET request to fetch weather data from the API. We'll fetch the current weather for a city. For our example, let's use London. import requests # Mock URL for London's weather (no real API key needed) url = 'https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22' # Send the GET request response = requests.get(url) # Process and display the result if response.status_code == 200: data = response.json() print(f\"Weather in {data['name']} - {data['weather'][0]['description']}\") print(f\"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}K\") This script will print the current weather description and temperature in Kelvin for London. Note : The data returned is in JSON format. It's structured and easy to parse in Python, which makes it a popular choice for APIs. APIs can return a lot of data. Here, besides the weather description and temperature, you can also access humidity, pressure, wind speed, and much more. Explore the data dictionary to uncover these details. Sending Data with POST Requests in Python While GET requests are primarily used to retrieve information from a server without causing any side effects, POST requests serve a different purpose. The POST method is designed to submit data to a server, usually resulting in a change in the server's state, such as creating a new record, updating data, or triggering an action. In essence, while GET is about asking the server for specific data, POST is about sending data to the server. With that understanding, let's delve into how to send data using POST requests in Python. For the sake of our pedagogical example, let's use JSONPlaceholder , a free fake online REST API used for testing and prototyping. Specifically, we'll be simulating the process of creating a new post. Before sending data, we must prepare it. Let's consider we're creating a new blog post: # The data we want to send post_data = { \"title\": \"Understanding REST APIs\", \"body\": \"REST APIs are fundamental in web services...\", \"userId\": 1 } This is our blog post with a title, body, and an associated user ID. With our data ready, we can send it using the requests library: import requests # The API endpoint where we want to create the new post url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts' # Sending the POST request response = requests.post(url, json=post_data) # Output the result if response.status_code == 201: print(f\"Successfully created! New Post ID: {response.json()['id']}\") else: print(\"Failed to create the post.\") Here, we've specified the URL to which we want to send the data and provided our post data in JSON format. Note : It's essential to check the response status code. A 201 status indicates that our data was successfully received and a new resource was created on the server. When you send a POST request, the server typically responds with details about the newly created resource. In our example, the server returns the ID of the newly created post, which we then print. POST requests are crucial when we want to send or update data on a server. With the requests library in Python, this process is streamlined, making data submission and interactions with web services smooth and efficient. Now that we've learned how to interact with REST APIs using Python, let's explore how to build our own API using Flask. Building a Simple Flask API Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, making it easy to build web applications and RESTful services. In this section, we'll set up a simple Flask API that counts API requests and provides a method to determine the number of letters in a given name. First, install Flask: pip install flask Create a new file named app.py . This will be our main application file. For our example, we'll use the following code: from flask import Flask, jsonify, request app = Flask(name) # Initialize a counter request_count = 0 @app.route('/api/count', methods=['GET']) def count(): global request_count request_count += 1 return jsonify({\"count\": request_count}) @app.route('/api/letter_count', methods=['POST']) def letter_count(): global request_count request_count += 1 data = request.json name = data.get(\"name\", \"\") return jsonify({\"name\": name, \"letter_count\": len(name)}) if name == 'main': app.run(debug=True) This code sets up a Flask application with two routes: 1. /api/count : When accessed, it increases a counter and returns the current count. 2. /api/letter_count : Accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing a name and returns the number of letters in the name. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing app.py and run: python app.py The Flask server should start, and by default, it'll be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Requesting the Flask API using Python With our Flask API running, let's now query it using Python: Create a new file named client.py and add the following code: import requests # Making a GET request to the count endpoint count_response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/count') print(count_response.json()) # Making a POST request to the letter_count endpoint data = {\"name\": \"Alice\"} letter_count_response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/letter_count', json=data) print(letter_count_response.json()) The first request will return the current request count, while the second one will tell us the number of letters in the name \"Alice\". Flask provides an intuitive way to set up RESTful APIs quickly. With just a few lines of code, we've set up a server that can handle requests, perform operations, and return data. By understanding these basics, you can extend the functionality and integrate more complex operations, such as serving machine learning models.","title":"Introduction to REST APIs"},{"location":"developpement/api.html#development-for-data-scientist","text":"","title":"Development for Data Scientist:"},{"location":"developpement/api.html#deploying-a-machine-learning-model-using-a-rest-api-in-python","text":"In this lesson, we'll learn about REST APIs and how to deploy a machine learning model using Flask in Python .","title":"Deploying a Machine Learning Model using a REST API in Python"},{"location":"developpement/api.html#what-is-model-deployment","text":"Model deployment refers to the process of integrating a trained machine learning or statistical model into a production environment.

In this section, we will explore how to use this library to interact with an example API. For our hands-on learning, we'll fetch weather data using the requests library in Python. The requests library is a de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a simple API. In the following example, we'll use the requests library to fetch weather data from an API. OpenWeatherMap offers weather data, which is free for limited access. Although you typically need an API key, for brevity, we're using a mock API endpoint for our exercise.","title":"Interacting with REST APIs using Python"},{"location":"developpement/api.html#crafting-a-get-request-for-weather-data","text":"We can use the requests library to make a GET request to fetch weather data from the API. We'll fetch the current weather for a city. For our example, let's use London. import requests # Mock URL for London's weather (no real API key needed) url = 'https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22' # Send the GET request response = requests.get(url) # Process and display the result if response.status_code == 200: data = response.json() print(f\"Weather in {data['name']} - {data['weather'][0]['description']}\") print(f\"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}K\") This script will print the current weather description and temperature in Kelvin for London. Note : The data returned is in JSON format. It's structured and easy to parse in Python, which makes it a popular choice for APIs. APIs can return a lot of data. Here, besides the weather description and temperature, you can also access humidity, pressure, wind speed, and much more. Explore the data dictionary to uncover these details.","title":"Crafting a GET Request for Weather Data"},{"location":"developpement/api.html#sending-data-with-post-requests-in-python","text":"While GET requests are primarily used to retrieve information from a server without causing any side effects, POST requests serve a different purpose. The POST method is designed to submit data to a server, usually resulting in a change in the server's state, such as creating a new record, updating data, or triggering an action. In essence, while GET is about asking the server for specific data, POST is about sending data to the server. With that understanding, let's delve into how to send data using POST requests in Python. For the sake of our pedagogical example, let's use JSONPlaceholder , a free fake online REST API used for testing and prototyping. Specifically, we'll be simulating the process of creating a new post. Before sending data, we must prepare it. Let's consider we're creating a new blog post: # The data we want to send post_data = { \"title\": \"Understanding REST APIs\", \"body\": \"REST APIs are fundamental in web services...\", \"userId\": 1 } This is our blog post with a title, body, and an associated user ID. With our data ready, we can send it using the requests library: import requests # The API endpoint where we want to create the new post url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts' # Sending the POST request response = requests.post(url, json=post_data) # Output the result if response.status_code == 201: print(f\"Successfully created! New Post ID: {response.json()['id']}\") else: print(\"Failed to create the post.\") Here, we've specified the URL to which we want to send the data and provided our post data in JSON format. Note : It's essential to check the response status code. A 201 status indicates that our data was successfully received and a new resource was created on the server. When you send a POST request, the server typically responds with details about the newly created resource. In our example, the server returns the ID of the newly created post, which we then print. POST requests are crucial when we want to send or update data on a server. With the requests library in Python, this process is streamlined, making data submission and interactions with web services smooth and efficient. Now that we've learned how to interact with REST APIs using Python, let's explore how to build our own API using Flask.","title":"Sending Data with POST Requests in Python"},{"location":"developpement/api.html#building-a-simple-flask-api","text":"Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, making it easy to build web applications and RESTful services. In this section, we'll set up a simple Flask API that counts API requests and provides a method to determine the number of letters in a given name. First, install Flask: pip install flask Create a new file named app.py . This will be our main application file. For our example, we'll use the following code: from flask import Flask, jsonify, request app = Flask(name) # Initialize a counter request_count = 0 @app.route('/api/count', methods=['GET']) def count(): global request_count request_count += 1 return jsonify({\"count\": request_count}) @app.route('/api/letter_count', methods=['POST']) def letter_count(): global request_count request_count += 1 data = request.json name = data.get(\"name\", \"\") return jsonify({\"name\": name, \"letter_count\": len(name)}) if name == 'main': app.run(debug=True) This code sets up a Flask application with two routes: 1. /api/count : When accessed, it increases a counter and returns the current count. 2. /api/letter_count : Accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing a name and returns the number of letters in the name. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing app.py and run: python app.py The Flask server should start, and by default, it'll be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.","title":"Building a Simple Flask API"},{"location":"developpement/api.html#requesting-the-flask-api-using-python","text":"With our Flask API running, let's now query it using Python: Create a new file named client.py and add the following code: import requests # Making a GET request to the count endpoint count_response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/count') print(count_response.json()) # Making a POST request to the letter_count endpoint data = {\"name\": \"Alice\"} letter_count_response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/letter_count', json=data) print(letter_count_response.json()) The first request will return the current request count, while the second one will tell us the number of letters in the name \"Alice\". Flask provides an intuitive way to set up RESTful APIs quickly. With just a few lines of code, we've set up a server that can handle requests, perform operations, and return data. By understanding these basics, you can extend the functionality and integrate more complex operations, such as serving machine learning models.","title":"Requesting the Flask API using Python"},{"location":"developpement/colorize.html","text":"Development for Data Scientist: Practical session 2: Deploying a digit classifier Now that you have a good understanding of the PyTorch framework and how to deploy your model through a REST API or a web application, you will develop an application that will colorize black and white images.

Using docker in data science projects has two advantages: Improving the reproducibility of the results Facilitating the portability and deployment In this session, we will try to package the code from our Gradio applications, allowing us to predict digits labels and to colorize images into a Docker image. We will then use this image to instantiate a container that could be hosted on any physical device to run the app. We will first create the Dockerfile corresponding to our environment. On your local machine, create a new file named Dockerfile containing the following code: # Base image from pytorch FROM pytorch/pytorch # Set up for your local zone an UTC information ENV TZ=Europe/Paris RUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime && echo $TZ > /etc/timezone # Additional librairies RUN pip install gradio tensorboard RUN pip install markupsafe==2.0.1 Take a moment to analyze this dockerfile. As you can see, it is built upon an existing image from Pytorch. Starting from existing images allows for fast prototyping. You may find existing images on DockerHub . The Pytorch image we will be using is available here . If docker is not already installed in your machine, follow this guide to install it. You may now build your first image using the following command: sudo docker build -t [your_image_name] [path_to_your_dockerfile] The image should take a few minutes to build. Once it is done, use the following command to list the available images on your device: sudo docker image ls How many images can you see? What do they refer to? Now that our images are built, we can use them to instantiate containers. Since a container is an instance of an image, we can instantiate several containers using a single image. We will run our first container using the interactive mode. Run the following command to run your fist container: docker run -it --name [your_container_name] [your_image_name] You should now have access to an interactive terminal within your container. On this terminal, open a Python console and check that Pytorch is installed. import torch print(torch.__version__) Quit the Python console and quit your container using ctrl+d . You can list all your running containers using the following command: sudo docker container ls Your container is closed and does not appear.

Using docker in data science projects has two advantages: Improving the reproducibility of the results Facilitating the portability and deployment In this session, we will try to package the code from our Gradio applications, allowing us to predict digits labels and to colorize images into a Docker image. We will then use this image to instantiate a container that could be hosted on any physical device to run the app. We will first create the Dockerfile corresponding to our environment. On your local machine, create a new file named Dockerfile containing the following code: # Base image from pytorch FROM pytorch/pytorch # Set up for your local zone an UTC information ENV TZ=Europe/Paris RUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime && echo $TZ > /etc/timezone # Additional librairies RUN pip install gradio tensorboard RUN pip install markupsafe==2.0.1 Take a moment to analyze this dockerfile. As you can see, it is built upon an existing image from Pytorch. Starting from existing images allows for fast prototyping. You may find existing images on DockerHub . The Pytorch image we will be using is available here . If docker is not already installed in your machine, follow this guide to install it. You may now build your first image using the following command: sudo docker build -t [your_image_name] [path_to_your_dockerfile] The image should take a few minutes to build. Once it is done, use the following command to list the available images on your device: sudo docker image ls How many images can you see? What do they refer to? Now that our images are built, we can use them to instantiate containers. Since a container is an instance of an image, we can instantiate several containers using a single image. We will run our first container using the interactive mode. Run the following command to run your fist container: docker run -it --name [your_container_name] [your_image_name] You should now have access to an interactive terminal within your container. On this terminal, open a Python console and check that Pytorch is installed. import torch print(torch.__version__) Quit the Python console and quit your container using ctrl+d . You can list all your running containers using the following command: sudo docker container ls Your container is closed and does not appear.

Throughout the training process, you'll utilize TensorBoard for the following purposes: Keeping an eye on your network's performance as epochs progress. Organizing your different experiments and hyperparameters. Generating visualizations to aid in analysis. Once the training process is complete, you'll also learn how to export your model in a format that can be used for inference. Finally, you will learn how to deploy your model on a REST API using Flask and how to request it using a Python script. Practical session repository: If you haven't already done so, create an account on Github . Then fork this repository and clone it on your computer. The network class: Using the figure above, fill in the following code, in the model.py file, to create the network class: The method __init__() should instantiate all the layers that will be used by the network. The method forward() describes the forward graph of your network. All the pooling operations and activation functions are realized in this method. Do not forget to change the shape of your input before the first linear layer using torch.flatten(...) or x.view(...) . import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F class MNISTNet(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super(MNNISTNet, self).__init__() self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(...) self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(...) self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(...) self.fc1 = nn.Linear(...) self.fc2 = nn.Linear(...) self.fc3 = nn.Linear(...) def forward(self, x): x = F.relu(self.conv1(x)) # First convolution followed by x = self.pool(x) # a relu activation and a max pooling# x = ... ... x = self.fc3(x) return x The training script The earlier file included your model class. Now, you will proceed to finalize the training script, named train.py . This script will serve as a Python script for training a neural network on the MNIST Dataset. Both the train() and test() methods have already been implemented. import argparse from statistics import mean import torch import torchvision import torchvision.transforms as transforms import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F import torch.optim as optim from tqdm import tqdm from model import MNISTNet # setting device on GPU if available, else CPU device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu') def train(net, optimizer, loader, epochs=10): criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() for epoch in range(epochs): running_loss = [] t = tqdm(loader) for x, y in t: x, y = x.to(device), y.to(device) outputs = net(x) loss = criterion(outputs, y) running_loss.append(loss.item()) optimizer.zero_grad() loss.backward() optimizer.step() t.set_description(f'training loss: {mean(running_loss)}') def test(model, dataloader): test_corrects = 0 total = 0 with torch.no_grad(): for x, y in dataloader: x = x.to(device) y = y.to(device) y_hat = model(x).argmax(1) test_corrects += y_hat.eq(y).sum().item() total += y.size(0) return test_corrects / total Now you will implement the main method, which will be executed each time the Python script is run. You'd like to offer users the flexibility to adjust certain learning process parameters, specifically: Batch size Learning rate Number of training epochs To achieve this, the Python argparse module will be employed. This module simplifies the creation of user-friendly command-line interfaces. Incorporating arguments into a Python script through argparse is a straightforward process. To begin, you'll need to import the argparse module and create a parser instance within the main method: import argparse if __name__=='__main__': parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() Then, just add a new argument to the parser precising the argument's name, its type, and optionaly a default value and an helping message. parser.add_argument('--exp_name', type=str, default = 'MNIST', help='experiment name') Finaly, you can use the arguments as follows: args = parser.parse_args() print(args.exp_name) Complete the main method to parse the four possible arguments provided when executing the script: if __name__=='__main__': parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument('--exp_name', type=str, default = 'MNIST', help='experiment name') parser.add_argument(...) parser.add_argument(...) parser.add_argument(...) args = parser.parse_args() exp_name = args.exp_name epochs = ... batch_size = ... lr = ... The following code instantiates two data loaders : one loading data from the training set, the other one from the test set. # transforms transform = transforms.Compose( [transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))]) # datasets trainset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST('./data', download=True, train=True, transform=transform) testset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST('./data', download=True, train=False, transform=transform) # dataloaders trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, num_workers=2) testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False, num_workers=2) Instantiate a MNISTNet and a SGD optimizer using the learning rate provided in the script arguments. Call the train method to train your network and the test method to evaluate it. Finally, print the test accuracy. net = ... # setting net on device(GPU if available, else CPU) net = net.to(device) optimizer = optim.SGD(...) train(...) test_acc = test(...) print(f'Test accuracy:{test_acc}') Save your model using the torch.save method. This method takes two arguments: the first one is the object to save, the second one is the path to the file where the object will be saved. Here, you will save the model's state dictionary ( net.state_dict() ) in a file named mnist_net.pth . The state dictionary is a Python dictionary containing all the weights and biases of the network. torch.save(net.state_dict(), 'weights/mnist_net.pth') You should now be able to run your python script using the following command in your terminal: python train.py --epochs=5 --lr=1e-3 --batch_size=64 Monitoring and experiment management Training our model on MNIST is pretty fast. Nonetheless, in most cases, training a network may be very long. For such cases, it is essential to log partial results during training to ensure that everything is behaving as expected. A very famous tool to monitor your experiments in deep learning is Tensorboard. The main object used by Tensorboard is a SummaryWriter . Add the following import: from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter and modify the train method to take an additional argument named writer . Use its add_scalar method to log the training loss for every epoch. def train(net, optimizer, loader, writer, epochs=10): criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() for epoch in range(epochs): running_loss = [] t = tqdm(loader) for x, y in t: x, y = x.to(device), y.to(device) outputs = net(x) loss = criterion(outputs, y) running_loss.append(loss.item()) optimizer.zero_grad() loss.backward() optimizer.step() t.set_description(f'training loss: {mean(running_loss)}') writer.add_scalar('training loss', mean(running_loss), epoch) In the main method instantiate a SummaryWriter with writer = SummaryWriter(f'runs/MNIST') and add it as argument to the train method. Re-run your script and check your tensorboard logs using in a separate terminal: tensorboard --logdir runs You can use tensorboard to log many different things such as your network computational graph, images, samples from your dataset, embeddings, or even use it for experiment management. Add a new method to the MNISTNet class to get the embeddings computed after the last convolutional layer. def get_features(self, x): x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x))) x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x))) x = x.view(-1, 16 * 4 * 4) return x Now these following code to the end of your main function to log the embeddings and the computational graph in tensorboard. #add embeddings to tensorboard perm = torch.randperm(len(trainset.data)) images, labels = trainset.data[perm][:256], trainset.targets[perm][:256] images = images.unsqueeze(1).float().to(device) with torch.no_grad(): embeddings = net.get_features(images) writer.add_embedding(embeddings, metadata=labels, label_img=images, global_step=1) # save networks computational graph in tensorboard writer.add_graph(net, images) # save a dataset sample in tensorboard img_grid = torchvision.utils.make_grid(images[:64]) writer.add_image('mnist_images', img_grid) Re-run your script and restart tensorboard. Visualize the network computational graph by clicking on Graph . You should see something similar to this: Click on the inactive button and choose projector to look at the embeddings computed by your network Deploying your model with Flask: Now that your model is trained, you will deploy it using a simple Flask application. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. The following code is a simple Flask application that will load your model and given an image, it will return the predicted class. The application will listen on port 5000 and will have a single route /predict that will accept a POST request with an image as payload. The image will be received as a byte stream and will first be converted to a PIL image, then will be transformed using the same transformation as during training to be fed to the model. The model will return a tensor containing the probabilities for each class. The class with the highest probability will be returned as a JSON object. Complete the following code to take the path of your model as an argument and load it in the model variable. import argparse import torch import torchvision.transforms as transforms from flask import Flask, jsonify, request from PIL import Image import io from models import MNISTNet device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu') app = Flask(__name__) parser = ... ... model_path = ... model = MNISTNet().to(device) # Load the model model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path)) model.eval() transform = transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize((28, 28)), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,)) ]) @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST']) def predict(): img_binary = request.data img_pil = Image.open(io.BytesIO(img_binary)) # Transform the PIL image tensor = transform(img_pil).to(device) tensor = tensor.unsqueeze(0) # Add batch dimension # Make prediction with torch.no_grad(): outputs = model(tensor) _, predicted = outputs.max(1) return jsonify({\"prediction\": int(predicted[0])}) if __name__ == \"__main__\": app.run(debug=True) Save the code in a file named mnist_api.py and run it with: python mnist_api.py --model_path [PATH_TO_YOUR_MODEL] Now run the test_api.ipynb notebook to test your API. We requested the api one image at a time. As you may already know, neural networks are much more efficient when they are fed with a batch of images. Modify the mnist_api.py by adding a new route /batch_predict that will accept a batch of images and return a batch of predictions and test it with the last cell of the test_api.ipynb notebook. @app.route('/batch_predict', methods=['POST']) def batch_predict(): # Get the image data from the request images_binary = request.files.getlist(\"images[]\") tensors = [] for img_binary in images_binary: img_pil = Image.open(img_binary.stream) tensor = transform(img_pil) tensors.append(tensor) # Stack tensors to form a batch tensor batch_tensor = torch.stack(tensors, dim=0) # Make prediction with torch.no_grad(): outputs = model(batch_tensor.to(device)) _, predictions = outputs.max(1) return jsonify({\"predictions\": predictions.tolist()}) ``` ## A simple GUI with tkinter The file `mnist_gui.py` contains a simple GUI that will allow you to draw a digit and send it to the API to get a prediction. Run the script with: ```bash python mnist_gui.py --model_path [PATH_TO_YOUR_MODEL] and provide some of the images in the MNIST_sample folder as input to your model. Deploying your model with Gradio As you can see, the GUI is very simple and not very user friendly. Gradio is a library that allows you to quickly create a user friendly web interface for your model. Install the library: pip install gradio Creating an application with Gradio is done through the use of its Interface class The core Interface class is initialized with three required parameters: fn: the function to wrap a user interface around inputs: which component(s) to use for the input, e.g. \"text\" or \"image\" or \"audio\" outputs: which component(s) to use for the output, e.g. \"text\" or \"image\" \"label\" Gradio includes more than 20 different components , most of which can be used as inputs or outputs. In this example, we will use a sketchpad (which is an instance of the Image component )component for the input and a Label component for the output. gr.Interface(fn=recognize_digit, inputs=\"sketchpad\", outputs='label', live=True, description=\"Draw a number on the sketchpad to see the model's prediction.\", ).launch(debug=True, share=True); Complete the mnist_webapp.py to either load your model weights or use your api to perform the predictions and run your app with the following command: python mnist_app.py --weights_path [path_to_the weights] Is your model accurate with your drawings? Do you know why it is less accurate than on MNIST? Git Commit all the modifications you have made to the repository as well as the weights and push them to your remote repository. Docker Dockers are a way to package your application and all its dependencies in a single image that can be run on any machine. The file Dockerfile contains the instructions to build a docker image that will run your application. Build the image with the following command: sudo docker build -t mnist-flask-app . This will create a docker image named mnist-flask-app . A docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform. You can list all the images on your machine with the following command: sudo docker images A docker container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. Run the container with the following command: sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 mnist-flask-app You can now access your application by going to http://localhost:5000 in your browser. By defult the container will run the command python mnist_app.py --weights_path weights/mnist_net.pth when it starts. That's it! You have created a docker image that can be run on any machine that has docker installed. By doing so, you have created a reproducible environment for your application that can be run on any machine. This is very useful when you want to deploy your application on a server or in the cloud. To list all the running containers use the following command: sudo docker ps To list all the containers (running and stopped) use the following command: sudo docker ps -a To stop a container use the following command: sudo docker stop [CONTAINER_ID] To remove a container use the following command: sudo docker rm [CONTAINER_ID] To remove an image use the following command: sudo docker rmi [IMAGE_ID] DO NOT FORGET TO DELETE YOUR DOCKER IMAGE AND CONTAINER WHEN YOU ARE DONE.

Complete the following code to take the path of your model as an argument and load it in the model variable. import argparse import torch import torchvision.transforms as transforms from flask import Flask, jsonify, request from PIL import Image import io from models import MNISTNet device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu') app = Flask(__name__) parser = ... ... model_path = ... model = MNISTNet().to(device) # Load the model model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path)) model.eval() transform = transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize((28, 28)), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,)) ]) @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST']) def predict(): img_binary = request.data img_pil = Image.open(io.BytesIO(img_binary)) # Transform the PIL image tensor = transform(img_pil).to(device) tensor = tensor.unsqueeze(0) # Add batch dimension # Make prediction with torch.no_grad(): outputs = model(tensor) _, predicted = outputs.max(1) return jsonify({\"prediction\": int(predicted[0])}) if __name__ == \"__main__\": app.run(debug=True) Save the code in a file named mnist_api.py and run it with: python mnist_api.py --model_path [PATH_TO_YOUR_MODEL] Now run the test_api.ipynb notebook to test your API. We requested the api one image at a time. As you may already know, neural networks are much more efficient when they are fed with a batch of images. Modify the mnist_api.py by adding a new route /batch_predict that will accept a batch of images and return a batch of predictions and test it with the last cell of the test_api.ipynb notebook. @app.route('/batch_predict', methods=['POST']) def batch_predict(): # Get the image data from the request images_binary = request.files.getlist(\"images[]\") tensors = [] for img_binary in images_binary: img_pil = Image.open(img_binary.stream) tensor = transform(img_pil) tensors.append(tensor) # Stack tensors to form a batch tensor batch_tensor = torch.stack(tensors, dim=0) # Make prediction with torch.no_grad(): outputs = model(batch_tensor.to(device)) _, predictions = outputs.max(1) return jsonify({\"predictions\": predictions.tolist()}) ``` ## A simple GUI with tkinter The file `mnist_gui.py` contains a simple GUI that will allow you to draw a digit and send it to the API to get a prediction.

You will have to: Set up a new GCloud instance with GPU capacities Write your Python scripts on your local machine Send your code to your GCloud Instance Run your code on the cloud virtual machine Monitor your code running on the virtual machine Get your results and send them to your local machine The solution is available here. Try to complete the practical session without looking at it! Set up your virtual machine First follow the GCloud setup process described here . The python script Cloud providers charge by the hour, so cloud computing can quickly get expensive. A good practice consists of doing most of the code development on your local hardware before sending it to your cloud instances. That is what you are going to do in this practical session. You will run one small iteration of your code on your local machine to test your code and then send it to your virtual machine. We will be working with the Landscapes dataset composed of 4000 images in seven categories of landscapes (city, road, mountain, lake, ocean, field, and forest). Instead of using it to train a classifier, we will use it to train a neural network to colorize black and white images. Create a script download_landscapes.sh with the following content and execute it to download and extract the dataset. cd data wget https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-data-and-models/raw/master/datasets/images/landscapes/landscapes_small.zip mkdir landscapes unzip landscapes_small.zip -d landscapes rm landscapes_small.zip rm -r landscapes/__MACOSX cd .. We will use a particular category of neural networks to perform the colorization operation: Unets . Initially designed for Biomedical Image Segmentation, Unets offer state-of-the-art performances in many segmentation tasks. These performances are mainly due to the skip connections used in UNets architectures. Indeed, Unets are a particular form of Auto-Encoders using skip connections between corresponding layers of the encoder and the decoder. Create a new file named unet.py where you will define the following Unet network: Help yourself with the above image to implement a Unet network using the following template: import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F def double_conv(in_channels, out_channels): # returns a block compsed of two Convolution layers with ReLU activation function return nn.Sequential( nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 3, padding=1), nn.ReLU(), nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, 3, padding=1), nn.ReLU() ) class DownSampleBlock(nn.Module): def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels): super().__init__() self.conv_block = ... self.maxpool = ... def forward(self, x): x_skip = ... out = ... return out , x_skip class UpSampleBlock(nn.Module): def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels): super().__init__() self.conv_block = ... self.upsample = ... # use nn.Upsample def forward(self, x, x_skip): x = self.upsample(x) x = torch.cat([x, x_skip], dim=1) # concatenates x and x_skip x = self.conv_block(x) return x class UNet(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.downsample_block_1 = ... self.downsample_block_2 = ... self.downsample_block_3 = ... self.middle_conv_block = double_conv(128, 256) self.upsample_block_3 = ... self.upsample_block_2 = ... self.upsample_block_1 = ... self.last_conv = nn.Conv2d(32, 3, 1) def forward(self, x): x, x_skip1 = ... x, x_skip2 = ... x, x_skip3 = ... x = self.middle_conv_block(x) x = #use upsampleblock_3 and x_skip3 x = #use upsampleblock_2 and x_skip2 x = #use upsampleblock_1 and x_skip1 out = self.(x) return out if __name__=='__main__': x = torch.rand(16,1,224,224) net = UNet() y = net(x) assert y.shape == (16,3,224,224) print('Shapes OK') Check that your network is producing correct outputs by running your file with: python unet.py The Training script You will now implement the training procedure. Training a network to colorize images is a supervised regression problem. Consider \\(x\\) a grayscaled image and \\(y\\) its corresponding colored image. Training a parametrized network \\(f_\\theta\\) to predict colorized images \\(\u0177\\) amounts to minimizing the distance between the prediction \\(\u0177\\) and the actual \\(y\\) . That is to say minimizing \\(MSE(y, f_\\theta(x))\\) . Create a new file data_utils.py that will handle the dataset: from torchvision.datasets.folder import ImageFolder, default_loader, IMG_EXTENSIONS from torch.utils.data import DataLoader import torchvision.transforms as transforms class ImageFolderGrayColor(ImageFolder): def __init__( self, root, transform=None, target_transform=None, ): super(ImageFolder, self).__init__(root=root, loader=default_loader, transform=transform, extensions=IMG_EXTENSIONS, target_transform=target_transform) #TODO \u00e0 modifier def __getitem__(self, index): \"\"\" Args: index (int): Index Returns: tuple: (sample, target) where target is class_index of the target class. \"\"\" path, _ = self.samples[index] sample = self.loader(path) if self.target_transform is not None: target = self.target_transform(sample) if self.transform is not None: sample = self.transform(sample) return sample, target def get_colorized_dataset_loader(path, **kwargs): source_process = transforms.Compose( [transforms.Resize((224, 224)), transforms.Grayscale(num_output_channels=1), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.5], std=[0.5])]) target_process = transforms.Compose( [transforms.Resize((224, 224)), transforms.ToTensor()]) dataset = ImageFolderGrayColor(path, source_process, target_process) return DataLoader(dataset, **kwargs) Create a new file colorize.py and fill the train method in the following canvas (you can inspire yourself from the one in the MNIST example.

Fire up your GCloud instance. On a terminal, connect to your instance using the following command (replace the zone and instance name with yours): gcloud compute ssh --zone \"europe-west1-d\" \"your_instance_name\" Create a folder Workspace on your virtual machine: mkdir Workspace You can copy a file from your local machine to the virtual machine using the following command on your local terminal: gcloud compute scp [your_file_path] your_instance_name:Workspace/ --zone \"europe-west1-d\" Conversly, you can copy a from your virtual machine to your local machine the following command on your local terminal: gcloud compute scp bsf.pth your_instance_name:Workspace/ --zone \"europe-west1-d\" Add the --recurse argument to your command if you want to copy a folder. Copy the folder containing all your code into your virtual machine's Workspace folder. Also, copy the download_landscapes.sh file into your VM and execute it. You should now be able to run your python script and thus learn to colorize images. Run your script for one entire epoch to check that everything is working fine. We will now run our script for a few more epochs, but before that, we will create an ssh tunnel between our local machine and the virtual machine. Run the following command on your local machine with the correct name for your virtual machine (use your correct zone). gcloud compute ssh --ssh-flag=\"-L 8898:localhost:8898\" --zone \"us-central1-b\" \"example_instance_name\" This command connects you to your virtual machine and forwards its port 8898 to your local machine's port 8898 (you can change the port value if needed). Thanks to that, you will get access to the tensorboard interface running on the virtual machine through your local machine. Now on this terminal window, run the following command: tensorboard --logdir runs --port 8898 On another terminal, connect to your virtual machine and run your script with a few more epochs (like 10 for instance). On your web browser, go to the following adress: http://localhost:8898/ You should be able to access tensorboard. Check on your network graph. You should see the U shape of your Unet. You can now visualize the progression of your network while it is training in the images tab. Bonus synchronize with Rsync An easy way to synchronize your code with your VM is to use rsync Install rsync on your virtual machine : sudo apt-get install rsync Add the public key you\u2019re going to use to connect to the VM to the VM\u2019s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys On the virtual machine: touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Copy the content of your public key (It is usually located in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub on your local machine) in the opened file. Press ctrl+x then y then enter to save.

A good practice consists of doing most of the code development on your local hardware before sending it to your cloud instances. That is what you are going to do in this practical session. You will run one small iteration of your code on your local machine to test your code and then send it to your virtual machine. We will be working with the Landscapes dataset composed of 4000 images in seven categories of landscapes (city, road, mountain, lake, ocean, field, and forest). Instead of using it to train a classifier, we will use it to train a neural network to colorize black and white images. Create a script download_landscapes.sh with the following content and execute it to download and extract the dataset. cd data wget https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-data-and-models/raw/master/datasets/images/landscapes/landscapes_small.zip mkdir landscapes unzip landscapes_small.zip -d landscapes rm landscapes_small.zip rm -r landscapes/__MACOSX cd .. We will use a particular category of neural networks to perform the colorization operation: Unets . Initially designed for Biomedical Image Segmentation, Unets offer state-of-the-art performances in many segmentation tasks. These performances are mainly due to the skip connections used in UNets architectures. Indeed, Unets are a particular form of Auto-Encoders using skip connections between corresponding layers of the encoder and the decoder.
